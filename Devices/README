Building new package:
=====================

0. run qmake (it will generate the makefile, which is required later)
1. go to 'debian' directory and update all text files there;
2. return to this directory and type:

  dpkg-buildpackage -b

3. if the build was succesful a .deb package will be created in the directory
   above this one
